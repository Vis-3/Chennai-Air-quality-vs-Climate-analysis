Project description:

This project explores the interrelationships between climate and air quality in Chennai, India, using an integrated analysis approach. By analyzing air quality factors and their impact on temperature and rainfall, the project aims to understand the complex dynamics between these environmental elements.

Model and key findings:

An LSTM model is used to predict temperature based on various air quality factors. The success of the model suggests a significant influence of air quality on temperature in Chennai.
Rainfall prediction, however, exhibits mixed results, indicating that while selected factors play a role, other key influences are missing. The monsoon's dependence on pressure zones and regional climate suggests exploring these factors in future work.
Key takeaway:

The integrated analysis reveals valuable insights into the relationships between climate and air quality in Chennai. Identifying the most influential factors and understanding their patterns paves the way for further research and potential development of improved predictive models.

Future work:

Expand the analysis to incorporate additional climate variables like pressure zones and regional monsoon patterns to improve rainfall prediction.
Explore other machine learning models potentially capturing the complex interactions between climate and air quality in Chennai.
Investigate the socio-economic implications of climate-air quality interactions and potential intervention strategies.
Data and code:

The data and code used in this project are available in this repository.
